          <p>Hey there! This is David! I came up with the concept and got the ball rolling, so... I'm pretty big news around here. I studied Computer Science at Exeter University, graduating with a First which is pretty neat all things considered. Since it's my dream to become a successful indie game developer, I figured it was about time I released a game. So I started this project!</p>
          <p>I started making games since I was a wee-little 14 year old. They were all crap, understandably. But nowadays, I seem to be able to make slightly less crap games ;P. In all seriousness, it's pretty surreal seeing myself today. If I told myself back then that I would be making a game of this scale, I would have probably had a heart attack, because time travel is not a normal daily occurrence and my weak 14 year old heart probably couldn't take that.</p>
            
          <p>I've been working on this game for a few years now, and I'm really excited to finally release it!</p>

                Hi y'all, I'm Dillan! I studied Comp Sci at the Uni of Manchester, graduating with a first class degree. I started Containcorp with David during the early days of COVID-19 lockdown. What initially was a 10 week plan to release a game with 0 experience turned into quite the project huh!
              </p>
              <p>
                Since graduating, I've been working as a software engineer for Tesco, and trying to balance working on the game and handling the admin side of running a small studio. At this point, I can't wait for Containcorp to get out there - it's been 5 long and slightly laboured years, but we've hit our first of many goals - a pre-alpha release! 
              </p>
              <p>
              So far, I've been adding horrendous code within our codebase, as well as developing our online presence, through our game's website, wiki page and merch store!
